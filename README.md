# DesktopBackgroundsAndScreenSaver
Just simple and fun pictures to have them as a desktop background

# For MacOS Users
1. You have to download SaveHollywood and install it from the following link:
  - [SaveHollywood](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/SaveHollywood/about.html)
2. Open Settings and go to Desktop/Screensaver:
3. Set the video up with SaveHollywood (I recommend you to mute video to not get bothered by the sax sound everytime your PC goes inactive) ;)
